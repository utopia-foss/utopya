Demo project and models
=======================

utopya comes with a `demo project <https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopya/-/tree/main/demo>`_ that illustrates how to use utopya in your own projects.
It showcases the following capabilities of utopya:

- Example implementation for a utopya model
  - ``MinimalModel``: using only the minimal amount of utopya features
  - ``ExtendedModel``: showcasing more utopya features, using the :py:mod:`utopya_backend` and one of its ``BaseModel`` classes for a scaffolding of your own model.
- Creating a ``.utopya-project.yml`` file for project registration.
- Creating a ``<model_name>_info.yml`` file for model registration.
- Adding supplementary files:
  - Project-level updates to the :py:class:`~utopya.multiverse.Multiverse` configuration
  - A project-level base plot configuration pool

Below, you will find more information about the demo project and how it can be used as a blue print for your own utopya-based project.

Instructions
------------
First, install utopya according to the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`.
If all went well, you should be able to call ``utopya --help`` in your virtual environment.

Afterwards download this ``demo`` directory to a place of your choice and rename it; this will be the place where your own project and model will be implemented.
The files in this directory will be adjusted bit by bit to fit your project and model implementation.



Project setup
-------------
A project in utopya denotes an aggregation of model implementations.
These models may be grouped into a project because they use the same infrastructure and dependencies, address similar questions, or for any other reason.
Correspondingly, utopya attaches some functionality to a project that can be shared between models, like default configurations for simulations or data evaluation.

In order to coordinate project-level functionality, utopya needs to know about the structure of a project.
This is achieved via the ``.utopya-project.yml`` file, which contains project-level information: the project name, local paths, and metadata.

.. admonition:: Demo project file
    :class: dropdown

    .. literalinclude:: ../demo/.utopya-project.yml
        :language: yaml


Project registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next step is to let utopya know about the project.
To register your project with utopya, follow these steps:

#. Make sure your project directory is in the intended location and named to your liking.
#. Open the ``.utopya-project.yml`` file and edit the following entries:
    - ``project_name``: This should be the name of *your* project
    - ``paths``: Make sure the ``models_dir`` points to the right directory (relative to the info file).
      If you do not intend on using Python model tests and custom plot implementations, delete the corresponding entries.
    - ``metadata``: Adjust (or delete) the entries (but keep the ``metadata`` mapping, even if it is empty).
#. Enter your project directory and *from that directory* invoke the utopya CLI to register the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    utopya projects register .

You should get a positive response from the utopya CLI and your project should appear in the project list when calling:

.. code-block:: bash

    utopya projects ls

**Note:** Any changes to the project info file need to be communicated to utopya by calling the registration command anew.
You will then have to additionally pass the ``--exists-action overwrite`` flag, because a project of that name already exists.
See ``utopya projects register --help`` for more information.


Model setup
-----------
Let's get to the model implementation.

Again, utopya needs to know about the model and the corresponding files.
Like with projects, models can be registered using the CLI and an info file, here the ``<model_name>_info.yml`` file.

The ``MinimalModel``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As an example, let's register the ``MinimalModel``:

#. Enter the ``demo/models/MinimalModel`` directory
#. Call the registration command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        utopya models register from-manifest *_info.yml

After successful registration, you should be able to run the model:

.. code-block::

    utopya run MinimalModel

The ``ExtendedModel``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``ExtendedModel`` is a demo for a more complex model implementation.
Additionally, it also uses more features of utopya.
Key differences are:

- The implementation is split up into an ``impl`` *package* and a ``run_model.py``, that invokes the implementation.
- It implements the ``ExtendedModel`` class by inheriting from :py:class:`~utopya_backend.model.step.StepwiseModel` which takes care to implement all the simulation infrastructure and a step-wise model abstraction:
  - Shared PRNG and logger instances.
  - Logic to evaluate the ``write_every`` and ``write_start`` parameters that can be set via the utopya CLI.
  - A ``monitor`` method that communicates simulation progress to the frontend.
  - Abstractions for a modelling paradigm with stepwise iterations of constant time deltas, controlled by ``num_steps``, ``write_start`` and ``write_every``.
- The ``model_plots`` and ``model_tests`` are in use.
- The ``cfgs`` directory contains so-called *config sets*  which can be used to define certain sets of default run and evaluation configurations.

To register and run it, we can again use its manifest file (and an extended glob pattern that actually matches all manifest files):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd demo/
    utopya models register from-manifest **/*_info.yml --exists-action overwrite
    utopya run ExtendedModel


Your own model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For your own model, do the following:

#. Create a new directory within the ``models`` directory (or the corresponding directory defined in the project info file).
#. Add an info file akin to ``MinimalModel_info.yml``, changing the following entries:

  - ``model_name``: should be the name of *your* model
  - ``paths``: adapt the entries here, specifically that for ``executable`` and ``default_cfg``. These can also be paths relative to the info file.
  - ``metadata``: update or delete the entries in there.

#. Make sure you are in the correct directory and call the registration command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        utopya models register from-manifest *_info.yml

Your own model should now be registered and invokable via ``utopya run``.


Requirements for a model executable
-----------------------------------
The model executable need not be a Python script, it can be *any* executable.
It is a Python script in this example to allow for easy readability, but you can choose any programming language for your model implementation.

In fact, utopya does not pose *any* limitations on the executable: it can essentially do whatever it wants.
Only if you want to use more of utopya's features, complying to a certain behaviour is advantageous â€“ but that is all *optional*.

However, we do suggest that the executable complies to the following:

- It should expect one (and only one) additional argument: the absolute path to the YAML configuration file.
  There will not be any additional arguments to the executable.
- The executable should then load that configuration file, a YAML file, and use some of its information:

  - The ``seed`` entry to set the initial PRNG state; this is in order to increase reproducibility of model simulations.
  - The ``output_dir`` entry for the location of any output files; this is in order to have the output files managed by utopya. If using HDF5 output, consider using the ``output_path``, which is a path to an HDF5 file name inside the output directory.
  - The model configuration which is available under the ``<model_name>`` key, where ``<model_name>`` is given by the ``root_model_name`` key.

.. hint::

    All this (and the optional features outlined below) are implemented in the :py:class:`~utopya_backend.model.base.BaseModel` class.
    If you are implementing your model in Python, consider using that as a starting point instead of re-implementing it all by yourself.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
As you may have seen, the ``ExtendedModel`` has a separate file called ``run_model.py`` which is used as a model executable, while the actual implementation is done in the ``impl`` package.
This structure is useful if your model implementation gets more complicated.

Now, the ``impl`` package is never installed, but it needs to be importable from the model executable.
In Python, the ``__main__`` module cannot do relative imports, so a helper function, :py:func:`~utopya_backend.tools.import_package_from_dir`, is used to make the package accessible.

.. admonition:: Generic model executable
    :class: dropdown

    The following ``run_model.py`` file can be used as a model executable if:

    - The file is on the same level as a model implementation package called ``impl``
    - The model class is available as ``impl.Model``

    If this is not the case, simply adjust the corresponding lines:

    .. literalinclude:: ../demo/models/ExtendedModel/run_model.py
        :language: python

    .. hint::

        Do not forget to mark the executable ... as executable:

        .. code-block:: bash

            chmod +x run_model.py

Optional features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Optionally*, the following information from the config file can be taken into account to use more features of utopya:

- ``log_levels``: provides log levels for the ``backend`` and ``model`` loggers, also adjustable via the CLI.
- For step-based models:
    - ``num_steps``: the number of iterations, which can then be set directly from the CLI.
    - ``write_every`` and ``write_start``: for controlling the time steps at which data is written.
- Signal handling: To shut down gracefully, your simulation should listen to ``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGINT`` and end the simulation within a grace period (few seconds).
  To handle :ref:`stop conditions <stop_conds>`, it should listen to ``SIGUSR1``.

Also, the model may communicate its progress by emitting lines via STDOUT, which is picked up by utopya and translated into a simulation progress bar; this is the so-called **monitoring** feature.
To use monitoring, the output should match the following pattern:

.. code-block:: text

    !!map {progress: 0.01}

Here, ``progress`` denotes the individual simulation's progress and needs to be a float value between 0 and 1.
On utopya side, that line is interpreted as YAML and turned into a dict.

There can also be further entries in the monitor dict which are picked up by the frontend and evaluated via :ref:`stop conditions <stop_conds>`.

.. note::

    Make sure the monitor output appears on a single line, without any line breaks.
    Otherwise the frontend will not be able to parse it.

Data evaluation pipeline
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Being aware of where the model outputs its simulation data, utopya can initiate a data processing pipeline.
To that end, the following configuration files need to be added or adapted: ...

Remarks
^^^^^^^
- Strictly speaking, utopya does not require a model to be associated with a project.
  However, this makes many aspects of simulation control more convenient, which is why we recommend registering a project with utopya.
- Across utopya, there can be multiple models with the same name, e.g. if you want to run multiple versions of a model.
  Models can be distinguished via their ``label`` property, which can also be set via the CLI.
  If there is only one label available, that one will be used automatically; otherwise you might have to choose between "info bundles" using the ``--label`` CLI option.
