  description: A (dummy) model illustrating the extended utopya interface
  long_description: >
    This model does a little more than the MinimalModel, while the model
    dynamics are still mostly boring.
    Instead, the main aim is to use more parts of the utopya interface to
    allow simulation monitoring and data evaluation.
    Furthermore, it illustrated how a more complex package structure can be
    used to implement a model using Python.
