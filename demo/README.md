# Demo Project

This directory provides example model implementations and project structure.
Its aim is to show the ways in which utopya can be used with your own project and models.

The demo project showcases the following capabilities of utopya:

- Example implementation for a utopya model
    - `MinimalModel`: using only the minimal amount of utopya features
    - `ExtendedModel`: showcasing more utopya features, using the `utopya_backend` and its `BaseModel` classes for a scaffolding of your own model.
- Creating a `.utopya-project.yml` file for project registration.
- Creating a `<model_name>_info.yml` file for model registration.
- Adding supplementary files:
    - Project-level updates to the `Multiverse` configuration
    - A project-level base plot configuration pool

For more information and usage instructions, have a look at [the corresponding utopya documentation page](https://utopya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo.html).
