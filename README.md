The `utopya` package provides a simulation management and evaluation framework with the following feature set:

- **Run model simulations** in parallel and on cluster architectures
    - Conveniently perform parameter sweeps of arbitrary parameters with the help of the [paramspace][paramspace] package.
- A **powerful CLI** to run and evaluate models, including interactive plotting
- Integrates the [dantro][dantro] **data processing pipeline**:
    - Loads data into a hierarchical data tree, supplying a uniform interface
    - Gives access to a configuration-based **data transformation framework**, separating data preprocessing from visualization for increased generality
    - Easy extensibility of plot creators via model-specific plot implementations
- A **versatile configuration interface** for both simulation and evaluation:
    - Assembling multi-level model configurations, including several default levels
    - Assembling plot configurations with multiple inheritance, reducing redundant definitions
- Model, project, and framework registration and handling
- Managing data output directories
- Tools to simplify model test implementations or working without a CLI
- ... and more

The `utopya` package evolved as part of the [Utopia Project][Utopia-Project] and provides the frontend of the [Utopia modelling framework][Utopia].
Having been outsourced from that project, it can be used with arbitrary model implementations with a very low barrier for entry: in the simplest case, only the path to an executable is required to run simulations.
With more compliance to the utopya interface, more features become available.

The `utopya` package is **open source software** released under the [LGPLv3+][LGPL] license; see [below](#license-copyright).

# Installation
To install utopya, first enter the virtual environment of your choice.
The utopya package is available on [PyPI][utopya-pypi]:

```
pip install --pre utopya
```

Alternatively, use the following command to install from a certain branch:

```
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopya.git@<branch-name>
```

The above commands will install utopya and the utopya CLI, pulling in all requirements.
You should now be able to invoke the utopya CLI:

```
utopya --help
```

# Basic Usage
ðŸš§

See the [demo project](demo/) for an implementation example.
