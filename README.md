The `utopya` package provides a simulation management and evaluation framework with the following features:

- **Run model simulations** in parallel and on cluster architectures:
    - Conveniently perform parameter sweeps of arbitrary parameters with the help of the [paramspace][paramspace] package.
- A **powerful CLI** to run and evaluate models, including interactive plotting
- Integrates the [dantro][dantro] **data processing pipeline**:
    - Loads data into a hierarchical data tree, supplying a uniform interface.
    - Gives access to a configuration-based **data transformation framework**, separating data preprocessing from visualization for increased generality.
    - Easy extensibility of plot creators via model-specific plot implementations.
- A **versatile configuration interface** for both simulation and evaluation:
    - Assembling multi-level model configurations, including several default levels.
    - Assembling plot configurations with multiple inheritance, reducing redundant definitions.
- The `utopya_backend` package, which assists in implementing models.
- Registration and management of models, projects, and frameworks.
- Managing data output directories.
- Tools to simplify implementation of model tests and working without a CLI.
- ... and more

`utopya` evolved as part of the [Utopia Project][Utopia-Project] and provides the frontend of the [Utopia modelling framework][Utopia].
Having been outsourced from that project, it can be used with arbitrary model implementations and with a very low barrier for entry: in the simplest case, only the path to an executable is required to run simulations.
With more compliance to the utopya interface, more features become available.

The `utopya` package is **open source software** released under the [LGPLv3+][LGPL] license; see [below](#license-copyright).

<!-- start: installation -->

# Installation
To install utopya, first enter the virtual environment of your choice.
The utopya package is available on [PyPI][utopya-pypi]:

```bash
pip install utopya
```

This will install `utopya`, the `utopya_backend` and the utopya CLI, pulling in all requirements.
You should now be able to invoke the utopya CLI:

```bash
utopya --help
```

*Note:* utopya does not specify minimum versions for its requirements; but it is always tested using the latest versions of its dependencies (for Python 3.8 to 3.12).
In case you run into problems, consider upgrading the involved packages using `pip install --upgrade`.

## Optional Dependencies
To include all optional dependencies in the installation (e.g. for plotting networks), use the following command:

```bash
pip install utopya[opt]
```

This may require that you install the following packages first:
* [graphviz][graphviz]
    * See [the PyGraphviz docs](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html) for further instructions.

<!-- end: installation -->


# Getting started
* For a simple example, see the [demo project](demo/).
* For a larger example of how utopya can be used, have a look at [Utopia][Utopia].
* For more information, refer to the [utopya documentation](https://utopya.readthedocs.io/).
