## About `utopya`
`utopya` is a Python package that provides the frontend for the [Utopia] simulation framework but can also be used with other software.
It aims to provide a simulation management and evaluation framework with the following feature set:

- Model configuration with several update levels
- A powerful CLI to run and evaluate models
- Executing model simulations in parallel and on cluster architectures
- Managing data output directories
- Interfacing with the [dantro] data processing pipeline


## Installation
To install utopya, enter the virtual environment of your choice and call:

```
pip install https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopya.git
```

‚ö†Ô∏è utopya is **not** on PyPI (yet)!
The package of the same name is a scam that we are hoping to get removed soon.
