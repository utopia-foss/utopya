# -- Hidden Jobs --------------------------------------------------------------
# ... to be integrated in other jobs via "extends"

# Add reports
#
# 1) Unit test reports, see:
#       https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html
#
# 2) Cobertura coverage report visualization for MRs.
#
#    Note that this requires a special syntax with *relative* file paths in
#    the XML that do *not* include the test files.
#    This becomes a bit tricky for utopya, because there are two packages,
#    utopya and utopya_cli, and they may not be regarded as two *sources*,
#    otherwise the coverage report gets mixed up.
#    To that end, the coverage source needs to be the project directory and
#    the pyproject.toml file makes some settings to omit the test files.
