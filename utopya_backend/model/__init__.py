"""Provides classes that can be used for model implementation:

- :py:class:`~utopya_backend.model.base.BaseModel`: provides shared simulation
  infrastructure like a logger, a shared RNG and signal handling.
- :py:class:`~utopya_backend.model.step.StepwiseModel`: a base model class
  that is optimized for stepwise model iteration.

All these base models still require to be subclassed and certain methods being
implemented.
