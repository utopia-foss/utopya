# This file provides the basic configuration for the utopya Multiverse
#
# It is read in by the Multiverse during initialization and is subsequently
# updated by other configuration files to generate the meta configuration of
# the Multiverse, which determines all details of how a run is performed.
#
# The top-level keys here are used to configure different parts of Multiverse:
#   - properties of the Multiverse itself: `paths`, `perform_sweep`, ...
#   - properties of attributes: `worker_manager`, `run_kwargs`, ...
#   - and the parameter space that is passed on to the model instance
#
# NOTE that this configuration file documents some features in the comments.
#      This cannot be exhaustive. Check the docstrings of the functions for
#      further information.

  # From the two above, the run directory will be created at:
  #     <out_dir>/<model_name>/<timestamp>_<model_note>/
  # Subfolders will be:  config, eval, data

  # Change file permissions for certain folders.
  # Keys are managed multiverse directories (run, config, data, eval) and
  # values are strings representing octal permission levels for unix systems.
  # If None, will keep the default permissions (typically 755).
  # Be aware that subdirectories that are created later may not inherit these
  # permission levels and that the permissions are set _before_ a simulation
  # begins, not after it has finished, thus always requiring write permissions
  # for the user level.
  # Also note that this may not have an effect on Windows systems at all.

  # Whether to copy the executable to a temporary directory at the

  # accidental changes to the executable _during_ a simulation are prevented.

# Skipping universes ..........................................................
# Controls whether and when universe tasks will be skipped.
#
# Example use cases and corresponding configuration options:
#
#   A - Work should be done on a single machine and in one session;
#       in this case, skipping should be disabled completely.
#   B - Work may be joined from other machines to speed up completion;
#       for this, enable skipping and skip
#   C - Work should be done in two stages: first create all the output folders
#       and configurations, then work on them independently. For this case,
#       enable skipping and activate `skip_after_setup`.
#
skipping:
  # Whether skipping is enabled at all.
  #
  # This should be set to false if you want to ensure that only a single
  # Multiverse instance is allowed to generate simulation output.
  # In that case, any skip event will instead result in an error.

    # TODO Implement setting this via CLI… perhaps even more general?
    #      Coolest would be: allow frameworks to provide a mapping of each CLI
    #      debug level to an update dict.

  # Monitoring
  # How frequently to send a monitoring message to the frontend; note that the
  # timing needs to be implemented by the model itself
  monitor_emit_interval: 2.

  # The path to the config file to load
  # output_path: /abs/path/to/uni<#>/cfg.yml
  # NOTE This entry is always added by the frontend. Depending on which
  #      universe is to be simulated, the <#> is set.

  # Below here, the model configuration starts, i.e. the config that is used by
  # a model instance. It's meant to be nested under the model name itself and
  # a node of that name will always be added.
  # <model_name>:
    # ... more parameters ...
