        * ``stopped``: stopped via a deliberately sent signal from the
          'outside', e.g. a stop condition or a keyboard interrupt.
        * ``skipped``: skipped some time after invocation, e.g. as was
          determined by the setup function.
        * ``failed``: failed for some task-specific reason (exit code != 0)

        Args:
            num_workers (Union[int, str], optional): The number of workers
                that can work in parallel. If 'auto' (default), uses
                os.cpu_count(). If below zero, deduces abs(num_workers) from
                the CPU count.
            poll_delay (float, optional): How long (in seconds) the delay
                between worker polls should be. For too small delays (<0.01),
                the CPU load will become significant.
            spawn_rate (int, optional): How many workers to spawn each working
                loop iteration. If -1, will assign new tasks to all free
                workers.
            lines_per_poll (int, optional): How many lines to read from
                each stream during polling of the tasks. This value should not
                be too large, otherwise the polling is delayed by too much.
                By setting it to -1, all available lines are read.
            periodic_task_callback (int, optional): If given, an additional
                task callback will be invoked after every
                ``periodic_task_callback`` poll events.
            QueueCls (type, optional): Which class to use for the queue.
                Defaults to the FiFo :py:class:`queue.Queue`.
            reporter (WorkerManagerReporter, optional): The reporter associated
                with this WorkerManager, reporting on the progress.
            rf_spec (Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]], optional): The names of
                report formats that should be invoked at different points of
                the WorkerManager's operation.
                Possible keys are:

                    ``before_working``, ``while_working``,
                    ``after_work``, ``after_cancel``, ``after_fail``,
                    ``task_spawn``, ``task_finished``, ``task_skipped``.

                All other keys are silently ignored.

                The values of the dict can be either strings or lists of
                strings, where the strings always refer to report formats
                registered with the WorkerManagerReporter. This argument
                updates the default report format specifications.
            save_streams_on (Sequence[str], optional): On which events to
                invoke :py:meth:`~utopya.task.WorkerTask.save_streams`
                *during* work.
                Should be a sequence containing one or both of the keys
                ``on_monitor_update``, ``periodic_callback``.
            nonzero_exit_handling (str, optional): How to react if a WorkerTask
                exits with a non-zero exit code. For 'ignore', nothing happens.
                For 'warn', a warning is printed and the last 5 lines of the
                log are shown. For 'raise', the last 20 lines of the log is
                shown, all other tasks are terminated, and the WorkerManager
                exits with the same exit code as the WorkerTask exited with.
                Note that 'warn' will not lead to any messages if the worker
                died by SIGTERM, which presumable originated from a fulfilled
                stop condition. Use 'warn_all' to also receive warnings in
                this case.
            interrupt_params (dict, optional): Parameters that determine how
                the WorkerManager behaves when receiving KeyboardInterrupts
                during working.
                Possible keys:

                    ``send_signal``: Which signal to send to the workers. Can
                        be SIGINT (default), SIGTERM, SIGKILL, or any valid
                        signal as integer.
                    ``grace_period``: how long to wait for the other workers to
                        gracefully shut down. After this period (in seconds),
                        the workers will be killed via SIGKILL. Default is 5s.
                    ``exit``: whether to sys.exit at the end of start_working.
                        Default is True.

            cluster_mode (bool, optional): Whether similar tasks to those that
                are managed by this WorkerManager are, at the same time, worked
                on by other WorkerManager. This is relevant because the output
                of files might be affected by whether another WorkerManager
                instance is currently working on the same output directory.
                Also, in the future, this argument might be used to communicate
                between nodes.
            resolved_cluster_params (dict, optional): The corresponding cluster
                parameters.
